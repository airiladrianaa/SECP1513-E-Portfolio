### 🗒️ Summary
I had the privilege of hearing from the leadership team at PPG, including the APAC IT Lead, Data Analytics Lead, Cloud Architecture Lead, and SAP Operations DTR Lead. As a first-year Computer Science student, it was a valuable opportunity to see how enterprise-level technology functions outside of a classroom setting. The talk delved into the complex world of Data Analytics, Infrastructure, and SAP. My biggest takeaway was seeing how global organizations bridge the gap between massive data streams and actionable business intelligence. It’s not just about the code; it’s about building a scalable infrastructure that can support thousands of users while maintaining security and efficiency. Understanding how these "As-Is" industrial landscapes are modernized into "To-Be" digital architectures has given me a much clearer roadmap for my own studies in systems development. 🚀

### 💡 Reflection
The industry talk regarding PPG provided a unique look at how technology and industrial processes intersect within the Malaysian corporate landscape. Through this talk, I gained knowledge on how digital infrastructure supports large-scale operations and the importance of maintaining data integrity in an industrial setting. Designing the poster for this assignment helped me learn how to distill complex industrial information into a visually engaging format for a wider audience. I suggest that future talks include more specific case studies of network failures to help students understand real-world troubleshooting. I found that visual storytelling is a powerful tool for explaining technical concepts to non-experts.
