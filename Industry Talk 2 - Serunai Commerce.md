### 🗒️ Summary
It was a privilege to hear from Ts. Hj. Abdul Alim bin Abdul Muttalib, the Head of Technology and Innovation at Serunai Commerce Sdn Bhd. As a first-year Computer Science student, it was a valuable opportunity to see how the theoretical concepts of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) are applied to manage large-scale, real-world projects. The talk delved into the complex world of balancing technical execution with strategic planning. My biggest takeaway was seeing how professional frameworks like Agile and Waterfall are used to bridge the gap between initial system requirements and a successful final deployment. It’s not just about the code; it’s about building a scalable foundation through proper initiation, planning, and execution while maintaining security and efficiency. Understanding how these management methodologies prevent project failure has given me a much clearer roadmap for my own studies in systems development. It’s one thing to study project management in a textbook, but seeing it applied at this level to solve industry challenges was truly inspiring! 🚀

### 💡 Reflection
The session with Serunai Commerce Sdn. Bhd. opened my eyes to the importance of the Halal digital ecosystem and the role of technology in global trade. I gained a deeper understanding of how blockchain and data analytics can be used to ensure transparency and trust in digital commerce. It was inspiring to see a Malaysian company leading innovation in a niche yet vital global market. I suggest that future sessions include a deeper dive into the specific API integrations they use to manage their platforms. This talk encouraged me to think about how I can use my programming skills to solve ethical and logistical problems in the digital economy.
