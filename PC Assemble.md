## 🖥️ PC Assemble

**📅 Date:** 12 November 2025  
**🕙 Time:** 10:50 a.m – 11:40 a.m.  
**📍 Venue:** Software Innovation Lab, Room 322 - 02, Level 3, Block N28

### 🗒️ Summary
My group and I spent the session taking apart and putting back together a workstation to see how everything actually works inside the case. As a first-year Computer Science student, it was a great experience to finally handle the hardware parts like the motherboard, CPU, and power supply instead of just looking at them in slides. The best part was learning how all these pieces fit together to make the system run. We had to be really careful with the cables and make sure every part was sitting perfectly in its spot. It definitely showed me that being a good developer also means understanding the machine your code runs on! 🚀 Huge thanks to my teammates for the great teamwork during the lab!

### 💡 Reflection
Participating in the PC assembly lab was a vital practical experience that bridged the gap between theoretical computer architecture and physical hardware. Physically handling components like the motherboard, CPU, and RAM provided a much clearer understanding of system integration than reading a textbook alone. I gained confidence in hardware troubleshooting and recognized the importance of precision when building a computer. An improvement for future labs would be to include a section on advanced BIOS configuration and cable management to further enhance our technical autonomy. This lab sparked my curiosity about hardware optimization and how it impacts overall software performance.
