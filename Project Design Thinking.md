### 🗒️ Summary
This was the toughest assignment for my SECP1513 course, but it was also the most rewarding. My team and I worked together to design a digital solution specifically for the autism community, and we just finished our final report documenting our entire journey from start to finish. The project taught us so much about the importance of empathy in technology. We spent a lot of time in brainstorming sessions and deep discussions to make sure our ideas actually solved real-world problems. It was an amazing experience to see our hard work come together into a final prototype. Huge thanks to my teammates for the incredible collaboration throughout the whole process. We definitely pushed each other to do our best! 🚀

### 💡 Reflection
Working on the "Sensory Touch" smartwatch prototype was a transformative experience that highlighted the power of empathy-driven design for the autism and ADHD community. Developing this solution required a deep dive into user-centric problem solving to ensure the prototype addressed real sensory challenges. A significant highlight of this project was the class presentation session, where my classmates and I shared our different digital solutions. Watching everyone's presentations provided me with a broader perspective on how technology can be adapted for various needs; for instance, seeing how other groups handled user interface simplicity or integrated feedback sensors gave me new ideas for future design iterations. From these diverse ideas, I learned that there are multiple creative ways to solve the same problem if you truly understand the user's perspective. To improve this project in the future, I suggest conducting broader user testing sessions with neurodiverse individuals during the early stages to ensure the prototype meets their functional requirements. This project confirmed my desire to use technology as a tool for inclusivity and social support.
