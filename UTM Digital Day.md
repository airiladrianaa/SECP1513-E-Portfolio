### 🗒️ Summary
I had the opportunity to attend a talk focused on Project Management and System Development within UTM. As a first-year Computer Science student, it was eye-opening to see the bridge between classroom theory and how large-scale campus systems are actually built and managed. The session highlighted the delicate balance between technical execution and strategic planning. My main takeaway was the importance of a structured development lifecycle—ensuring that every line of code serves a specific organizational need and follows a clear roadmap from concept to deployment. It’s one thing to build a software project, but it’s another to manage it at a university-wide scale. This experience has definitely sharpened my perspective on how I want to approach my future development projects! 🚀

### 💡 Reflection
Attending the UTM Digital Day on 29 October 2025 provided me with essential insights into the practical application of system development in the technology industry. Learning from Helmee bin Yaacob about how Agile methodology allows teams to remain flexible and responsive to user needs was particularly impactful. I gained a better understanding of how teamwork and professional communication are just as vital as technical coding skills when managing complex projects. To improve future sessions, I would suggest including a brief hands-on demonstration of Agile tools to provide a more practical understanding of the workflow. I believe that applying these management techniques immediately to my group assignments will lead to much more consistent progress.
